            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
            enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for
            the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
            tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the
            present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley
            teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of
            my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall
            grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by
            me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
